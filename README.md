## Localization

[Edit this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OKFriFyzpZhV6XEzPE3T7F6j6Pk10PMdi-oIy1-iYN8)

Whenever you work on the project, please commit the (updated) locales. We will indeed update the files on every run (no matter serve or build), but we want to have them in the repository anyway for two reasons: a) it's possible to work without internet connection and b) it's always good to have an independent backup ;)

## Install

```
yarn
yarn run dev
```


## Build

```
yarn
yarn run build
```
